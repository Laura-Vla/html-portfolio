<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi there! I'm Laura and I am 36 years old. I am complete beginner in the the
  field of IT. I'm interested in coding and Web Development. I have zero
  programming experience, but I aspire to learn everything to succeed as a
  developer.
</p>

<p>
  I've always had a thing for design. From a young age, I've been fascinated to
  build and create things. So far, I've gone through one cours on Udemy, and I
  can say I love this, is really cool. Moving forward, I hope to learn new
  things and to be able to start a career.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not learning, I like to explore this beautiful planet with my dear
  husband and our two beautiful children. I also love to take pictures and make
  videos in our travels and adventures.
